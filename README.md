# COVID-19 Global Cases – Week 2 Data Analysis Project

## Project Goal
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on real-world COVID-19 data to understand global trends, case growth, and overall pandemic impact.

## Dataset Details
- Dataset Name: covid19.csv  
- Columns: Date, Country, Confirmed, Recovered, Deaths  
- Source: Our World in Data (OWID) via Kaggle Archive

## Tools and Libraries
- Platform: Google Colab  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## What Was Done

### 1. Data Loading and Cleaning
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Checked for and handled missing values
- Removed any duplicate records

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Displayed the first few records
- Generated summary statistics
- Counted number of countries present in the dataset
- Identified the most affected countries in terms of confirmed cases and deaths

### 3. Visualizations
- Line chart showing global confirmed cases over time  
- Bar chart of the top 10 countries with the highest death toll  
- Pie chart comparing total recovered vs deaths globally

### 4. Observations and Insights
- United States had the highest number of cases and deaths
- Recovered cases globally outnumbered deaths significantly
- Sudden spikes in cases or deaths indicated delayed reporting or data backlogs
- Certain countries had stronger recovery rates, reflecting better healthcare response

## Final Note
This project helped me practice working with real-time datasets, apply Python-based data analysis techniques, and draw meaningful insights. It was a valuable hands-on experience in data visualization and interpretation.
